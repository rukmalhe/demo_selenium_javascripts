Selenium IDE commands
=====================
command - > what action to perfom
target - >  The element selector or URL
value - > Optional input, like the text to enter or text to assert

sample: 
{
      "id": "assert-manage-vacancies",
      "comment": "Verify Correct Text is present",
      "command": "assertText",
      "target": "css=h2",
      "targets": [],
      "value": "Welcome, Please Login.!"
    },


Command types
=============
Actions - These are commands that directly interact with the browser.

For example:

"Click" command - It is the Actions command because it directly interacts with the element on the page by clicking on it.

"Type" command - It is a two-way interaction. Enters text/values ​​into the field, and the field displays them to us.

Common Command Examples
=======================

Command: `open`
Target: `/login`
Value: n/a
Open the `/login` URL relative to base


Command: `assertText`
Target: `css=h2`
Value: `Welcome`
Fails the Test when an `h2` tag not contains the text "Welcome"

Command: `verifyText`
Target: `css=h2`
Value: `Welcome`
Assert when an `h2` tag not contains the text "Welcome", the test will continue..


Command: `assertText`
Target: `css=a.small-link`      // . period is required
Value: `Back to the Home Page`
Verify 'a' small-link css contains above text


Command:  `storeText`
target: "css=a.small-link"
value: "homeLinkText"
Store the value as a variable homeLinkText

Commnand: `assertTitle`
Target: `Login Page`                 
Value: *(empty)*
Verify that the page title is "Login Page"

Command: `verifyText`
Target: `xpath=//p[@class='status']`
Value:  `Success`
Non-failing version of `assertText`

Accessors - These are commands that allow us to store values ​​in a variable.
==========
For example:

"storeTitle" command - Reads the page title and stores it in a variable. There is no interaction with the browser here.

Click - Clicks a specific item

Type - Enters text/values ​​into the indicated fields

Verify/assert title - Compares the specified page title with the actual one

Verify/assert text - Checks whether the specified text exists on the page

Verify/assert element not present - Checks that the specified element is not present on the page

Pause - Stops script execution for the specified time. In Value, we enter the time, eg 5000. This will cause the script to stop for 5 seconds.
