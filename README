# 🧪 Selenium WebDriverJS Test Suite for Job Agency Admin Portal

This project contains automated end-to-end tests written in JavaScript using **Selenium WebDriver** and **Mocha** for the [Job Agency Admin Portal](https://relaxed-trifle-0879d7.netlify.app/login). The tests simulate real user actions like logging in, adding vacancies, uploading images, and verifying UI content.


## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Admin login/logout flow
- ✅ Valid and invalid credential checks
- ✅ Form submission for adding vacancies
- ✅ File upload to Cloudinary and preview verification
- ✅ Role-based navigation and title assertion
- ✅ Page content and element visibility validation
- ✅ Fully refactored using helper functions for reusability


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as test framework
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Cloudinary API for image uploads
- Firefox browser (or Chrome, configurable)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-agency-admin-tests.git
cd job-agency-admin-tests
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Update file upload path**

Ensure you use an **absolute path** for file uploads, or use Node’s `path.resolve()` for a cross-platform relative solution.

4. **Run the tests**

```bash
npx mocha "tests/web-driver-js/adminLoginTest.spec.js"
```

---

## ✍️ Helper Functions

All reusable actions like login, click safety, and input handling are placed in `helpers.js`:

```js
await fillAndSubmitLoginForm(driver, username, password)
await clickElementSafely(driver, By.id("logout"))
```

These ensure better reliability with waits and error handling.

## ✅ Sample Test Scenario (Admin Login)

* Visit `/login`
* Verify title and welcome heading
* Enter valid credentials and login
* Assert redirection to home page
* Logout and verify redirection

---

## 🖼️ Image Upload via Cloudinary

The `addVacancy` test includes Cloudinary integration:

* Signature fetched from serverless endpoint
* Upload via `axios.post()` in frontend
* Image preview asserted via `#photo-preview`


---

## 🧪 Sample Assertion

```js
assert.strictEqual(await driver.getTitle(), "North West Recruitment Service")
assert.strictEqual(await driver.findElement(By.css("h1")).getText(), "Welcome ! North West Recruitment")
```

## 📌 Notes

* Firefox is the default browser. For Chrome, change `.forBrowser('firefox')` to `.forBrowser('chrome')`.
* Tests rely on **explicit waits** and fallback to **JS-based interaction** for non-interactable elements.
* Assertions are meaningful and help verify test intent clearly.
